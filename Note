By using Bash, save the code as .sh file

In sublime:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World !"

In Ubuntu:
chmod +x ./helloWorld.sh     // give execution authority to the script
./helloWorld.sh              // execute script

The first line of the code is used to tell the system what kind of shell that are used to interpret the script
without the first line, we could add an extra code in Bash:

/bin/sh helloWorld.sh



By using PowerShell in Windows10, asve the code as .bat/.ps1 file

In sublime:
echo "Hello World !"

In PowerShell:
./helloWorld.bat              // execute script
./helloWorld.ps1              // execute script

The second one might get an error of 

./helloWorld.ps1 : File E:\Sublime Text\Sublime Text 3\codes\helloWorld.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts
is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
